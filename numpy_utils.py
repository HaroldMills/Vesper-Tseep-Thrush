def find(x, y, tolerance=0):
    
    """
    Finds all occurrences of one one-dimensional array in another.
    
    The algorithm employed by this function is efficient when there are
    few occurrences of a small prefix of the first array in the second.
    It is inefficient in other cases.
    
    Parameters:
    
        x : one-dimensional NumPy array
            the array to be searched for.
            
        y: one-dimensional NumPy array
            the array to be searched in.
            
    Returns:
        list of starting indices of all occurrences of `x` in `y`.
